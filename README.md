Thanks: Appnitro pForm (http://www.phpform.org/) for the form template.

Instructions:

[These are a work in progress.  It's 2:10am.  I am tired.]

1) Import the Sample.sql to your database.
	- There is 1 table with 3 columns.
	- There are 6 rows of sample data.
2) Update the mysqlConnect.php with your database user information.
	- You'll need to set username, password, database as per mysqli.
3) Import your data into your database.
4) Setup your website so the data is accessible
5) Attempt to use it

[To Do]

* Build an import front-end so you don't need something like PMA.
* Clean up the queries so they're less exploitable
* More to Come
